Step 1:  we need C compiler -> go to vs code website and download 
(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)
You can install the Desktop development with C++ workload without a full Visual 
Studio IDE installation. From the Visual Studio Downloads page, scroll down until you see 
Tools for Visual Studio under the All Downloads 
section and select the download for "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022."

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

This will launch the Visual Studio Installer, which will bring up a dialog showing the 
available Visual Studio Build Tools workloads. Check the Desktop development 
with C++ workload and select Install.

Check your Microsoft Visual C++ installation

To open the Developer Command Prompt for VS, start typing 'developer' in the Windows 
Start menu, and you should see it appear in the list of suggestions. The exact name 
depends on which version of Visual Studio
 or the Visual Studio Build Tools you have installed. Select the item to open the prompt.

 You can test that you have the C++ compiler, cl.exe, installed correctly by typing 'cl'
  and 
 you should see a copyright message with the version and basic usage description.

 2) install c make
 pip install cmake
 to ckeck -> 
 cmake --version

 3)install dlib
 Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
 ensure cmake installed

pip install dlib

#...to verify....
import dlib
print(dlib.__version__)

4)Install  face-recognition

Prerequisites
*c++ build Tools
*cmake  pip install cmake
*dlib   pip install dlib

pip install face-recognition

Verify...
import face_recognition
print(face_recognition.__version__)


5) Install cvzone
pip install cvzone


6)Install numpy and opencv
pip install numpy<2      (to compatible with opencv)
pip install opencv-contrib-python
